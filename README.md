# Flask RESTful API with JWT Authentication

This project is a RESTful API built with Flask, supporting JWT-based authentication and role-based access control (Admin, User).

## Features
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login and role assignment (Admin, User).
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for managing items.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restricted access to endpoints based on user roles.
- **In-Memory Storage**: No database integration, data stored in memory for demonstration.
